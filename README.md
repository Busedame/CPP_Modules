# üñ•Ô∏è‚ú® **An introduction to C++!**

## üöÄ **Project Overview**  
This repository contains all the C++ modules that I did at 42 Berlin. It is a complete beginner's introduction to C++. Each module contains a small set of exercises, and each module/exercise introduces new concepts. 

##

### CPP_00

- Creating a class.
- Printing to stdout and reading from stdin.
- Private vs public attributes.
- Trimming strings using `setw()`.

##

### CPP_01

- Memory allocation.
- Referencing.
- Pointers to members.
- Usage of switch.

##

### CPP_02

- Integer/float conversions.
- Fixed point values.
- Orthodox canonical form.
- Overloads.

##

### CPP_03

- Derived classes.
- Class inheritance.

## üß∞ **Included Files**  
In each module:
- All the exercises (containing Makefile, header file(s), source file(s)).

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Cloning the Repository**

To get started, first clone the repository.
This command will clone the repo, and move you to the right directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/busedame/CPP_Modules/ CPP_Modules && cd CPP_Modules
```

## üñ•Ô∏è **How to Compile and Run**  
For each of the exercises inside the modules (e.g. ex00 in CPP_00), there is a Makefile.
Each exercise contains a different program.

1. **Compile the program**:  
   Run the following command to compile the program:  
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. **Run the program**:
   Run the program using:
   ```bash
   ./<program_name_as_specified_in_Makefile>
   ```
